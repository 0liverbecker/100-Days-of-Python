#   One Day i create a Band Name Generator
##   i learn something about Print, input, 

#print ('Day 1 - \nPython Print Function')
#print ("The function is declared like this")
#print ("print('what to print')")
#print ("Oliver " + "Becker")

 #  By inputs you can model in to a Sentence 
print ("Hello " + input ("Whats your name?") + "!")


#   Here the Programs count the lenge of a word and print it out
#   you can do it with a variable
#nameZiffern = input ("Whats your name? ")
#print (len(nameZiffern))
#   or you write it in to the sentence
#print (len(input("Write a Wort: ")))

#   Variable switch
#a = input("a: ")
#b = input("b: ")
 #  how can i switch a to b and b to a?
 #  create a third variable to save one before you overwrite it
#c = a
#   now a is save in c and you can overwrite a
#a = b
#b = c

# 1. Create a greeting for your program
#print ("Welcome to my Bandname Creator!")
# 2 Ask the user for the City that they grew up in
#name_city = input("Aus welcher Stadt kommst du? \n")
# 3 Ask the user for the name of a pet
#name_pet = input("wie hie√ü dein erstes Haustier? \n")
# 4 Combine both inputs 
#print ("Your perfect Bandname is: " + name_city + " " + name_pet + " !")
## 5 make sure the input cursor shows on a new line
 # for this use the backslash plus n after each question. 
# so your cade looks better
