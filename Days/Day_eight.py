''' in this Lesson i write a program that Encrypt Data and encrypt this.

# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.
#def greet():
#    print ("number one")
#    print ("number two")
#    print ("number three")
#greet()
# now we do the same but with a input
#def greet_with(name):
#    print (f"hey {name}")
#
#greet_with("oli")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
import math
def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    number_can = ((height * width) /coverage)
    print ("You need "+str(math.ceil(number_can))+" cans.")


#Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
